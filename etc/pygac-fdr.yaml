    summary: >-
        Fundamental Data Record (FDR) of measurements from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at
        full Global Area Coverage (GAC) resolution. AVHRR GAC measurements have been calibrated to reflectances and
        brightness temperatures using the PyGAC software and PATMOS-X v2017 calibration coefficients. The data are
        accompanied by additional metadata (such as orbit overlap or equator crossing time) as well as basic quality
        indicators.
