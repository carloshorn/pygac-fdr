    summary: >-
        Fundamental Data Record (FDR) of measurements from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at
        full Global Area Coverage (GAC) resolution. AVHRR GAC measurements have been calibrated to Level 1C using the
        PyGAC software with PATMOS-X v2017 calibration coefficients. This includes the conversion from counts to
        reflectance or brightness temperature as well as inter-sensor calibration. The data are accompanied by
        additional metadata (such as orbit overlap and equator crossing time) as well as basic quality indicators.
